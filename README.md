This is a test project that uses the main features of hVHDL libraries. The example project is built with Lattice Diamond and tested with lattice ECP5 fpga. Efinix Efinity, Intel Quartus, Xilinx ISE and Vivado builds will be added soon.

Note, tested to NOT work with 3.11 version of Lattice Diamond on a Windoew 11. Either Version of 3.12 works.

To build the lattice project run
> pnmainc <path_to_example_project>/ecp5_build/build_ecp5.tcl
